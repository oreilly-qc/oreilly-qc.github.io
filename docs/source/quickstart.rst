QCEngine quickstart
===================

Installation
------------

Assuming you're reading this documentation through a web-browser, no installation is required to use QCEngine. Simply visit `the QCEngine website <https://oreilly-qc.github.io/>`_ to immediately start using its JavaScript interface.

The QCengine UI
---------------

Before detailing how to start writing QPU programs, we describe the different UI elements on the QCEngine webpage. These allow you to control simulations and a number of associated visualizations. When using the QCEngine UI, three windows are displayed:


The code window
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This is used to enter and run code. JavaScript entered in the text-box will be syntax-highlighted. The window can be resized using the handle on the bottom right. Code entered into this window describes a simulation to be run with QCEngine. Typically this code will setup and initialize a group of qubits, perform some operations on them, and then read the out. The simulation specified by the code is only actually run (using the CPU of your local machine) after the **Run Program** button is clicked (see below). 

.. image:: __static/ui_codewindow.png

* The **Run Program** button executes the code currently in the code window and consequently generates visualizations in the other UI windows described shortly.
* The **Examples dropdown menu** (set to `Ex 2-1: Random qubit` in the above image) can be used to populate the code window with existing code samples from book, referred to by their Example number.
* The **Engine dropdown menu** (set to `QCEngine` in the above image) can be used to change the simulator engine language for code displayed for the pre-existing book code-samples. Many code samples are also provided in the `Qiskit <https://qiskit.org/>`_ and `OpenQASM <https://github.com/Qiskit/openqasm>`_ languages.
* The **magnifier** buttons can be used to alter the text-size of code in the code window.

The circuit window
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
After the **Run Program** button has been clicked in the code window, the *circuit window* will display a circuit diagram for the code (assuming that the code is free from syntax errors).

.. image:: _static/ui_circuitwindow.png

* The **magnifier** buttons can be used to resize the circuit diagram within the circuit window. Using **ctrl-scroll** (holding `ctrl` whilst using a mouse/trackpad scroll gesture) also zooms in/out of the circuit diagram. 

* The circuit window interacts closely with the *circle notation window* (see below). When the cursor is hovered over a circuit diagram, a vertical orange bar appears to show which point in the circuit is currently being visualized in the *circle notation window* (defaults to the end of the circuit). Clicking on another part of the circuit will refresh the *circle notation window* to show a visualization of the QPU's state at this new point in the circuit (and the vertical orange marker line in the circuit will move accordingly). This interface can be used to 'step through' a QPU circuit.

The circle notation window
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This shows a visualization of the state of the QPU at a given point within the code. How to interpret circle notation visualizations is explained in detail in Chapter 2 of `Programming Quantum Computers <https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Quantum-Computers-Essential-Algorithms/dp/1492039683>`_.

.. image:: _static/ui_circwindow.png

* The **magnifier** buttons can be used to resize the circle notation shown within the circle notation window. Using **ctrl-scroll** (holding `ctrl` whilst using a mouse/trackpad scroll gesture) also zooms in/out of the circle notation. 

* The remaining **visualization assistance** buttons in the header of the circle notation window provide a number of options for making circle notation more easily visible (especially useful for large QPU registers visualized by large numbers of circles). These include adding 'rotation needles' for more prominently showing the rotation of circles, coloring the circles dependent on their rotation, and scaling the filled area of the circles (equivalent to a global phase - see page 20 of `Programming Quantum Computers <https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Quantum-Computers-Essential-Algorithms/dp/1492039683>`_). The filled-area of circles in the *circle notation window* can also be scaled using **shift-scroll** (holding *shift* whilst using a mouse/trackpad scroll gesture).

* Note that the point in the circuit at which a QPU's state is represented in the circle notation window can be altered by interacting with the *circuit window* (see above).


The output window
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The output window displays output printed from a QCEngine program using the :code:`qc.print()` function. JavaScript output (for example, printed using :code:`console.log()`) will still appear in your web-browser's developer JavaScript console as normal.

.. image:: _static/ui_outputwindow.png

* The **magnifier** buttons can be used to resize the text-size used in the output window. 

* The **eraser** button clears any current output in the output window.


Writing QCEngine code
---------------------

The QCEngine code written in the *code window* of the UI is JavaScript. However, a number of JavaScript objects and functions are globally defined in this environment, which expose the QCEngine simulator. Here we cover a quick introduction to these. More detailed information on all available QCEngine objects and functions can be found in the :ref:`cheatsheet <cheatsheet-label>`. For a more general (and brief) introduction to JavaScript syntax, see the section on :ref:`JavaScript <javascript-label>`.

The most fundamental tool we deal with in QCEngine code is the :code:`qc` object.


The :code:`qc` object and single-qubit operations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The :code:`qc` object represents the whole QPU being simulated by QCEngine, and exposes methods allowing us to associate qubits with this QPU and then manipulate and read them.

We always begin by specifying how many qubits we want to associate with our QPU using the :code:`qc.reset()` method. For example, we could prepare ourselves for a simulation of an 8-qubit QPU as follows:

.. code-block:: javascript
    
    // Request 8 qubits for simulation in our QPU
    qc.reset(8);

Considered together these 8 qubits can represent any 8-bit number (or, of course, superpositions of such numbers). Before we begin operating on these qubits we can initialize them to be a binary encoding of some integer value using the :code:`qc.write()` method:

.. code-block:: javascript
    
    // Write the value 120 to our 8 qubits (01111000)
    qc.reset(8);
    qc.write(120);

This means we've initialized the 8 qubits in our QPU in the states :math:`|0\rangle|1\rangle|1\rangle|1\rangle|1\rangle|0\rangle|0\rangle|0\rangle` - the binary representation of 120.

Having a set of initialized qubits, we can consider performing operations on them. The :code:`qc` object has methods corresponding to many single- and multi-qubit operations. Many of the single-qubit operation methods can be called without any argument to act the same single-qubit operation on *all qubits* in the QPU separately. 

For example, the following code applies a :code:`HAD` (Hadamard) operation to each qubit in the QPU:

.. code-block:: javascript
    
    // Perform HAD on all 8 qubits
    qc.reset(8);
    qc.write(120);
    qc.had();

This results in the following circuit:

.. image:: _static/quickstart_allhads.png

We can similarly :code:`READ` all 8 qubits in the QPU using the :code:`qc.read()` method, and again passing no argument to stipulate that the single-qubit :code:`READ` operation should act on all qubits in the QPU:

.. code-block:: javascript
    
    // Perform HAD on all 8 qubits
    qc.reset(8);
    qc.write(120);
    qc.had();
    qc.read();

Producing the following circuit:

.. image:: _static/quickstart_allhadreads.png

So far we've dealt only with single-qubit operations that act on *all* qubits in the QPU. What if we wanted to act a :code:`HAD` on only one specific qubit? Or what if we wanted to perform a multi-qubit operation on some specific subset of qubits? To do this we need a method for referencing qubits in the QPU.


Referencing qubits
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Many of the single qubit methods of the :code:`qc` object accept a parameter that references the location of a particular qubit to act the operation on. We can reference a qubit using decimal, binary or hexadecimal values. For example, the below snippet shows how each of these methods allows us to act a :code:`HAD` operation on only the second highest weighted qubit from 8 that we have requested for our QPU:

.. code-block:: javascript
    
    // Perform HAD only on the second highest weighted of 8 qubits 
    qc.reset(8);
    qc.write(0); // In this case we intialize all qubits to be in |0>
    // Each of these have the same effect
    qc.had(64); // In decimal - second highest weight qubit correponds to value of 2**6=64
    qc.had(0b01000000); // In binary - select out second highest weight qubit
    qc.had(0x40); // In hex - 0x80 is 64 in decimal 

Note that we employ these addressing methods using JavaScript's binary and hexadecimal literal syntax (:code:`0b` and :code:`0x` prefixes). As an aside, in each case JavaScript is actually converting the values to decimal before passing them to our method :code:`qc.had()` (this is why :code:`console.log(0b101)` will actually print :code:`5`).

The above code-snippet corresponds to the following circuit:

.. image:: _static/quickstart_hadreferencing.png

We can also easily operate single-qubit operations on a select *subset* of qubits in a single method call using the JavaScript *binary or* operator :code:`|` in our referencing. For example, we can act :code:`qc.had()` on the first two lowest weight qubits in an 8 qubit QPU as follows:

.. code-block:: javascript
    
    // Perform HAD only two lowest weighted of 8 qubits 
    qc.reset(8);
    qc.write(0); // In this case we intialize all qubits to be in |0>
    // Each of these have the same effect
    qc.had(1|2); // In decimal - two lowest weight qubits have values of 2**0=1 and 2**1=2
    qc.had(3); // Alternatively specify the single decimal value selecting two lowest weight qubits  
    qc.had(0b00000011); // In binary
    qc.had(0x1|0x2); // In hex
    qc.had(0x3); // Alternatively specify the single hexadecimal value selecting two lowest weight qubits  

We can see the equivalent effects of these approaches in the circuit diagram produced by this code-snippet:

.. image:: _static/quickstart_hadreferencing2qubits.png

Note that as well as an argument referencing the qubits to act on, some single-qubit operations also take additional parameters. For example, :code:`qc.phase()` accepts an angle to rotate the relative phase of a qubit through (first argument) as well as a specification of what qubits to act on (second argument). This code performs a relative phase rotation of 45 degrees on the middle two qubits in a 4-qubit QPU:

.. code-block:: javascript

    // Perform PHASE(45) on middle two of 4 qubits
    qc.reset(4);
    qc.write(0b1111); // In this case we intiialize all qubits to be in |1>
    qc.phase(45, 0b0110); // Here we opt to reference our qubits using a binary literal

This produces the following circuit:

.. image:: _static/quickstart_phasereferencing.png

Multi-qubit operations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The :code:`qc` object also has methods for performing multi-qubit operations. These operations normally require a specification of a **target** qubit, and a **control** qubit. The target qubit has a certain operation performed on it dependent on the value of the control qubit. For example, :code:`qc.cnot()` implements the important :code:`CNOT` operation, and takes a reference to the **target** qubit as its first argument, and a reference to the **control** qubit as its second argument:

.. code-block:: javascript

    // Perform CNOT between highest (target) and lowest (control) weighted of 4 qubits 
    qc.reset(4);
    qc.write(5); 
    qc.cnot(0b1000, 0b0001); // Here we opt to reference our qubits using binary literals

Which results in the following circuit:

.. image:: _static/quickstart_cnotreferencing.png

We can easily specify more target or control qubits for a multi-qubit operation, using the referencing system we introduced above. For example, consider the following code-snippet employing a CNOT with two target and two control qubits and its associated circuit:

.. code-block:: javascript

    // Perform CNOT between two highest (targets) and two lowest (controls) weighted of 4 qubits 
    qc.reset(4);
    qc.write(5); 
    qc.cnot(0b1100, 0b0011); // Here we opt to reference our qubits using binary literals

.. image:: _static/quickstart_cnotreferencingmulti.png

Grouping qubits using :code:`qint`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Sometimes we may wish to logically associate small subsets of a full QPU's set of qubits. We can think of such smaller groupings as 'registers' within our QPU. This kind of association can be achieved using :code:`qint` objects. After a set of qubits have been requested for a QPU using the :code:`qc.reset()` method, we can draw qubits from this available collection to associate with a :code:`qint` using the :code:`qint.new()` method. For example, the below code-snippet defines one 2-qubit :code:`qint` and one 6-qubit :code:`qint` from a QPU of 8 qubits.

.. code-block:: javascript

    // Define two qints
    qc.reset(8);
    qc.write(0); // Initialize all qubits at once before introducing qints
    var myqint1 = qint.new(2, 'My Qint 1');
    var myqint2 = qint.new(6, 'My Qint 2');


We can see that the :code:`qint` object is created with two arguments. The first specifies a number of qubits to associate with the :code:`qint`.  Note that this number of qubits is *drawn from the stack available in the QPU, starting from the lowest weight first*. We can see this in the circuit diagram generated by this code-snippet:

.. image:: _static/quickstart_qintsdefn.png

This circuit diagram also shows that the second argument to the :code:`qint` object is a label, which is shown on circuit diagrams in the *circuit window* to help us identify different :code:`qint`'s that we have defined. You'll notice that we've also assigned our new :code:`qint` objects to JavaScript variables. This is crucial, as these new objects implement many single- and multi-qubit methods, allowing us to act on qubits in reference to these smaller :code:`qint` collections.

For example we can act a :code:`HAD` operation on the lowest weight qubit in each :code:`qint` as follows:

.. code-block:: javascript

    // Define two qints
    qc.reset(8);
    qc.write(0); // Initialize all qubits at once before introducing qints
    var myqint1 = qint.new(2, 'My Qint 1');
    var myqint2 = qint.new(6, 'My Qint 2');

    // Act HADS on highest weight qubit in each qint.
    // Note that our references are now interpreted in relation 
    // to the qint, not the whole QPU as they were with the qc object
    myqint1.had(1);
    myqint2.had(1);

Giving the following circuit:

.. image:: _static/quickstart_qintshads.png

:code:`qint` objects are especially useful because they allow us (as their name suggests), to allocate a set of qubits to represent an integer (or other datatype), which we can then use in arithmetic, like we would in conventional CPU code. For example, the :code:`qint` object implements a :code:`qint.add()` method, which takes another :code:`qint` object as an argument, and produces the circuit required to perform quantum addition (i.e. addition that respects superpositions of values) between the integer values encoded in the two :code:`qint` objects:

.. code-block:: javascript

    // Define two qints
    qc.reset(8);
    // Define two qints
    var myqint1 = qint.new(2, 'My Qint 1');
    var myqint2 = qint.new(6, 'My Qint 2');
    // Write a value of 3 to the first qint
    myqint1.write(3);
    // Write a value of 14 to the second qint
    myqint2.write(14);

    // Perform (quantum) addition between the values stored in the two qints
    // Note will add onto the myqint2 register
    myqint2.add(myqint1);

    // Read output
    myqint2.read() // Gives answer 17
